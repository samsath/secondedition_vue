    <meta naem="description" content="SECONDEDITIONS is a collaborative partnership between Elizabeth Peebles and Markus Eisenmann
        that began in 2002 with the research into a number of artworks in public and private collections aiming to generate
        the possibility of unlimited editioning and recontextualisation of selected objects.
        The projectâ€™s parameters have since extended to include the processing of text video and sound. Works have been
        archived in the museum contexts of the collections of their origin a.o. at the British Museum London and
        Hamburger Kunsthalle.">
